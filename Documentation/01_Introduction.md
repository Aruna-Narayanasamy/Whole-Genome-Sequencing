# Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 #
 - WGS is a comprehensive method used to determine the complete DNA sequence of an organism’s genome in a single process. 
 - It captures all genetic information including coding and non-coding regions which makes it one of the most powerful tools for understanding genetic variation, pathogen evolution, and disease mechanisms.
 - WGS involves breaking the genome into small fragments, sequencing these fragments using high-throughput technologies and then computationally assembling or aligning them back to a reference genome. 
 - This enables scientists to identify mutations such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions, deletions, and structural changes.
